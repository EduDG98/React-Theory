# REACT

## Create a React App:
    npx create-react-app AppName

## React Components

- React components can be created as a class or as a function.
- It is a better practice to do it with arrow functions.
- A React component can has an other React component within.
- They always start with the first letter in upper case.

```js
const AppComponent = () => {
    return (
        <>
            
        </>
    )
}
```
